# book-engine
This is an open source project under Paytm - Build for India initiative, which will give the recommendation, predictions and search results based on author, genre and book title/ISBN

## Prototype

I have created a rough prototype for this project to demonstrate, how it will work. 
- Video Link [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSisLp8Z_Ag)
- Source code [here](https://github.com/PaytmBuildForIndia/book-engine/tree/master/kids-classic-books-alexa-skill)
- Documentation [here](https://github.com/PaytmBuildForIndia/book-engine/blob/master/kids-classic-books-alexa-skill/README.md)
- Alexa Skill [here](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078TLNT39/). This skill was part of Alexa Skills Kids Challenge 2018
- Test our chatbot here: https://www.facebook.com/BFIBookEngine/. By default you won't get any response, as it is in develpment, so send me your email id (the one you are registered on FaceBook) on twitter and I will add you as tester for chatbot. My twitter handle is @mukul1904

## Future Scope and Plans

I have lots of things in the pipeline, which I will be integrating into this skill.

- Machine Learning. Based on books requested by user, this skill will be able to suggest books to that user
- Gets data for Bestsellers
- List of books from author, the one user requested

Feel free to let me know of more feature you want to add in it by creating feature request.

## Contribution Guide

### Tech Stack

- We are currently using nodejs and python, and are open to any technlogy. For alexa skill we have used Alexa Skills Kit and for chatbot, AWS Lex. We have used AWS Lambda functions heavily, as they power both Alexa skills and chatbot.

- For database, we have used MongoDB.

- For nodejs we use ESLint to help make our code clean.
