# book-engine
This is an open source project under Paytm - Build for India initiative, which will give the recommendation, predictions and search results based on author, genre and book title/ISBN

## Prototype

## Future Scope and Plans

I have lots of things in the pipeline, which I will be integrating into this skill.

- Machine Learning. Based on books requested by user, this skill will be able to suggest books to that user
- Lists out books by genre
- Gets data for Bestsellers
- List of books from author, the one user requested
- Fetches weekly popular books
- Fetches all-time popular books

Feel free to let me know of more feature you want to add in it by creating feature request.
