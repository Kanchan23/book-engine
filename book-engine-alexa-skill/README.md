##  Book Engine Alexa Skill

Backend engine which can power an Alexa Skill.

## Inspiration

As a bibliophile, I wanted my Echo to tell me about books I want to read. It's rating, small description, publication year and much more. It's little easier than "googling it", as I can just ask for kids book to Alexa.

## What it does

User can ask this skill for any book, either by title or title and author, and this skill will return with some basic details like
- Publisher Name
- Publisher Year
- Goodreads review count and rating
- Description
- List of similar books etc
